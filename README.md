# NodeJs Profiling Investigations
> A repo for learning `node --prof`

This repo serves as a learning tool so that we can see how to profile your NodeJs app and how to break down the results so that you can write the friggin' sweetest apps known to 21st century mankind.

# Usage

Browse through the `prof/` results or checkout the code and run `npm start`.

# Layout

Each file in `src/` has a correlary file in `prof/` with performance results.

All runs are done on Darwin with Node v10.

A blog post will hopefully be coming soon to provide a guided tour of the repo.
